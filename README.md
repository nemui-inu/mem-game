# game-instructions

The game consists of two phases:

### 1. Memorize Phase

  During this phase, you will memorize the five (5) random words presented on screen. After five (5) seconds, the words will then disappear and you will enter the next phase.
### 2. Input Phase
  During this phase, you will fill in the missing words within the boxes in correct spelling, case and order. As you enter your input, corresponding points and lives will be given.

### Points and Life System

  Five (5) points will be given when the player enters a correct word (case, spelling, and order). When player the scores atleast two (2) consecutive perfect scores, the current score will be doubled. The player starts with three (3) max lives (:white_heart:). It will deduct (-:white_heart:) for every wrong input and will reward the player (+:white_heart:) for every correct input. As the player scores consecutive perfect scores (25 points), the maximum life limit is increased.
